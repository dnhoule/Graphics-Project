My town's theme is a Coffee Farm in the Tarrazu Province in Costa Rica. I wanted to captivate the hometown of my family in the heart of the Costa Rican mountains, where coffee farms dominate the landscape. This world depicts part of the process of coffee production, where I show the transportation from the farms to the roasting plant.
